// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// Three discontinuous custom time scales for the Timeline view
// 
// This example illustrates three discontinuous custom scales for the Timeline view
// which are properly aligned. The first scale is a day scale which skips Saturdays
// and Sundays. The second scale is an hour scale which contains only working hours
// from 6 to 21. The third scale with increments of 30 minutes displays hours from
// 6 to 21, like the second scale.
// Note the paint correction code which amends the
// color for the columns situated by the scale discontinuities.
//
